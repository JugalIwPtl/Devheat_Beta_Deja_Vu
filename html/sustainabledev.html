            <h2 class="contentin3">
                Following the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) framework, there are a wide variety of investments that can be considered “sustainable.” Industries that promote good environmental practices, via more renewable energy sources or by combating air and water pollution, are perhaps the first things that come to mind for most people. However, sustainable investing can also include investing in companies that support human rights initiatives or a more ethical corporate culture.</h2>
